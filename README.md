## THESIS - 2022
## Indoor Navigation using Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) and Feature Extraction (ORB) with obstacle detection technology for the blind. 
### 
This android project utilizes native c++ in opencv and DBOW2 library for image database creation.
It has been already connfigured with native opencv and ready to run as an aandroid studio project.
## TODO:
### Navigation:
- [ ] Obstacle avoidance - Midas/depth estimattion
- [ ] Corners Detection
- [x] Object Detection (tflite - mobilenet)
- [x] Specify Destination (using Voice Recognition)
- [x] Step Counter from current location to destination
- [x] Room recognition (DBW02)
### Map Creation:
- [ ] Step detector (Accelerometer Sensor)
- [x] Corners detection/labeling (Rotation Vector Sensor)
- [x] Room registration/renaming (PDR)
- [x] Create a vocabulary/database for place recognition (DBW02 c++)
